# BREAST CANCER PREDICTION
This project aims to build a predictive model for breast cancer using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The model is validated using cross-validation to ensure robustness and reliability.
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set, which contains 569 instances of breast cancer cases with 30 features each. The dataset is publicly available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
# Accuracy Score
With KNN and cross validation, obtained an accuracy score of  96.2%
